# Easy Coderbyte Solutions and Explanations
Hi all!

This contains the solutions and explanations for the "easy" coding problems on wwww.coderbyte.com in JavaScript. This was created to help myself better understand basic JavaScript by explaining every decision that I make as well as for others who are going through the problems as well.

I understand there are many, many other ways to solve these challenges so if you have a better way to solve a problem or see an issue that needs to be fixed, please say so!
