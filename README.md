# Easy Coderbyte Solutions and Explanations
Hi all!

This contains the solutions and explanations for the "easy" coding problems on wwww.coderbyte.com. This was created to help myself better understand basic Javascript by explaining every decision that I make as well as for others who are going through the problems as well.

I understand that there are other ways to solve the challenges so if you have a better way to solve a problem please say so!
